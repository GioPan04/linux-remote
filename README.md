# linux-remote

A KDE Connect replacement written in Rust. This is not a drop-in replacement, you'll need another client (currently I'm creating one in Dart/Flutter, it will be available soon)

## The reason

Why build this from the ground up? Well, I didn'y wanna to install all the kde dependencies only to control remotely my PC.
My version uses low level tools like uinput and uses little to no dependencies,
